# Companies hiring security remote

List of companies that hire security people full remote.

> This is an enhancement of [`jaegeral/companies-hiring-security-remote`](https://github.com/jaegeral/companies-hiring-security-remote) as it seems the repo is not maintained enough.

Remote is meant to allow people from anywhere (or at least anywhere in a given timezone) without being forced to be in an office on a daily base.  

I'm looking for a full remote position (EU)! See [edoardottt.com/cv](https://www.edoardoottavianelli.it/cv).

## FAQ

Q: Company xyz is listed but does not offer a remote job at the moment - why is it listed?

A: I try very hard to keep the list up to date as possible, so at the time of adding an organization, that org either offered a remote security job or had a public statement that they are remote friendly. But as time goes on, orgs might not have (remote) positions open or even change the approach to remote friendly environnment.

Q: Company xyz is not listed, but is remote friendly, can we add it?

A: Sure, either make a pull request, open an issue or send me an email at <edoardott@gmail.com>

Q: Is that page also available as webpage?
A: yes: <https://edoardottt.github.io/companies-hiring-security-remote/>
